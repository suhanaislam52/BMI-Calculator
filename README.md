# BMI Calculator
This is a clean and intuitive native Android application developed in Kotlin that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user-entered height and weight. It provides users with their BMI value along with a clear classification of their health status â€” such as Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese â€” making it easier to track personal fitness and well-being.

The app features a simple and responsive user interface, real-time BMI calculations, and input validation for smooth user experience. It is ideal for anyone interested in monitoring their health using a lightweight and efficient mobile tool built with modern Android development practices.
